# Overview
This is a basic platformer writen in Python using the arcade library. The player plays as a blue square who needs to get to the yellow goal flag. You can use the right/left arrows or A/D keys to move left and right, up or W to jump, and down or S to place blocks that you can use as platforms. Pressing R will delete the last block places and Q will close the game.

I wrote this program as a way to introduce myself to Python arcade and game development as a whole, and I'm personally happy with how it turned out.

# Future Work

As this was my first attempt, this game is not perfect by any means. Here are a few things I hope to learn about and change in the future:
* Turning the character around according to direction of movement
* Make the boxes pushable and effected by gravity
* More levels
* Hazards
